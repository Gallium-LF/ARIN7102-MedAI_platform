    review: `"I want to share my experience to possibly ease some of the ladies out there.
The incident occur in Nov 18 (the condom broke) and it was 4 days after my period ended and approximately 4 days before ovulation. This means I was fertile. 
when we noticed that the condom broke, we immediately bought Plan B One Step and was taken about 45 minutes or an hour later. 
The sooner you take the greater the chances it will work.
So I waited anxiously, praying I get my period. I felt side effects such as fatigue, bloated, nauseous, cramps, and moody. I was that these might be  this pregnancy symptoms. 
I waited exactly two weeks and I got my period. I was the happiest person ever. My period was here early by approximately 3-4 days. Good luck."`,

I&#039;m moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it&#039;s STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I&#039;m not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn&#039;t know. I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven&#039;t had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though! "`,

NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven&#039;t had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!"`,

If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!"`,

I was put on Paxil (gained so much weight) and then Zoloft. I took the Zoloft off and on for years until it just wasn&#039;t working for me anymore. I was then put on Welbutrin while still taking 25mg of Zoloft. I quit smoking (had no desire to smoke) but then became suicidal. My doctor then put me back on Effexor and I currently only take 75 mg. I feel amazing. Yeah the side effects are bad, I&#039;ve gained weight (lost weight the first time I was on it), have sexual side effects, and get quite shaky/jittery if I&#039;m late on a dose. But I&#039;m finally the mom I&#039;ve always wanted to be."`,

    review: `"I had my first routine colonoscopy at 54. I am extremely sensitive to drugs of any kind. I did not feel a thing from the time the needles entered my arm. Found myself conscious of being a very dark, completely peaceful place. I was aware of that. I thought I was finally THERE and when the nurse started trying to rouse me, I was not coming back. Not happy to be bothered and so certain I didn&#039;t want to come back, I became aggressive to the nurse and as has happened before, began to cry hysterically. There were staff around me but I couldn&#039;t see them. My friend later told me they did not know what to do and had not seen this reaction before. So I was in recover quite a while, unable to come out of it."`,

I have suffered from motion sickness all of my life (now 50 years old) and this medication is great. I used it on a 7 day cruise and had horrible side effects after. I had to use some other motion sickness medication to calm the dizziness and hard to focus side effects. I tried this patch again and it did not seem to work. I will try it again soon on another cruise and hope it works. I too have tried many different remedies and nothing worked as good as the patch. I would use it again even with the side effects. That is nothing compared to having control of your senses during a cruise."`,

During this time on Prozac I experienced TMJ which I had never had before. I used to dream of novacaine shots to get rid of the pain. 



I took a break from Prozac and the tmj disappeared. But I never connected the Prozac with tmj. Dr didn&#039;t and dentist didn&#039;t. 



Fast forward to now. Back on Prozac. Back with Tmj. :( 



Loved Prozac. Got rid of my ruminating thoughts and anxiety. I would give it a ten except for the tmj. 



Giving Zoloft a try. Hopefully no tmj."`,

I was tested for everything including MRI and using novocaine and other pain killers. Nothing helped. After 5 months of constant pain, my doctor suggested discontinuing Crestor. The pain was completely gone within a week. Come to find out, my Sciatic nerve passed through my Piriformis muscle instead of around it like in most people. The Crestor had caused toxicity in the Piriformis muscle  which caused it to squeeze the Sciatic nerve continuously, causing continuous pain."`,

My stool was so hard and big that it hurt to much to go. My doctor prescribed Miralax to me and it started to work a little. Then, she recommended I take two cap fulls in two cups of water instead of one in one. After a day or two, I went to go and it literally went from 100% bad to 100% great. I was not only able to go but it didn&#039;t hurt at all. It was so amazing to finally not be in pain that I literally cried. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with that kind of constipation."`,

Still high, I know but huge decrease from 12. I also have lost 40 lbs! I take it with Metformin &amp; Glipozide. I also am following low carb diet- most days. But, prior to Invokana, my sugar levels were high w/Metformin &amp; Glipozide &amp; very low carb diet. So, for me it&#039;s working. Hoping to get closer to 6 in next 3 months - then under 6 by a year.

-if you take them too often their effectiveness starts to wear off e.g you will still feel tired and not alert but you won&#039;t be able to sleep.

-NoDoz can interrupt your sleep and keep you awake during the night

-would alway recommended having plenty of water while using NoDoz otherwise you may start to feel dehydrated and may lead to headaches"`,

I experienced extreme anxiety which then lead to panic disorder. It sounds like it basically started from built up stress but, let me tell you my story as I want people to feel more comfortable and understand what&#039;s going on as I have done extensive research on the issue. 

First, anxiety and panic disorder are awful. You feel like you can&#039;t breathe, that you&#039;re having a heart attack, you get dizzy, you feel off balance, you get sweaty hands and feet, you&#039;re not comfortable and always anxious, sometimes you even feel that you&#039;re legs are going to give out. 

If the above feels like you  well I took Prozac and honestly it saved me. "`,

I got off it after 3 months and am about to try Sprintec...here&#039;s hoping this works out better!"`,

So I my psychologist said I have Generalized anxiety disorder and of my passing of my father a few years ago and bullying in school lead to all this. I started with Lexapro and after 3 days I stopped it made me feel so sick and I had university exams coming up so I started it again  3 weeks ago and the strange thing is I have little side effects!

Implanon is very convenient and effective. I have not experienced many negative side effects from the birth control. In fact, I have actually lost weight after starting it. The only side effects I have noticed is that my menstrual cramps have increased slightly. Definitely worth it!"`,

But if you can look past the spotting and irregular periods that come and go as they please, this is the BC for you.

    review: `"I have been on Seasonique for two years now and I love it!! It took about two packs, or six months, for my body to adjust to the new period cycle, but it wasn&#039;t a problem at all. I was 16 when I started taking it, and was surprised in how quickly it worked especially with my ever changing hormones. Having a period four times a year is AMAZING, and I have absolutely no spotting in between. Plus, when I do have my period, it only lasts for four or five days, and the longer I have been on Seasonique, the lighter they have become. The only downside for me is that I get an achy back and back spasms during the time of the period, but they are not severe and end soon as my period ends. Highly recommend!"`,

I only gave it an 8 instead of 10, because it does make my periods heavier and a little longer than in the past. Because of this I developed iron deficiency anemia, but the anemia is easily controlled with a prescription iron supplement 3 times per week (Mon/Wed/Fri), which is OK. I appreciate Paraguard because one of the other medications I take makes hormonal birth control less effective. Since Paraguard is not a hormonal birth control, it works perfectly. 

I have had a previous Paraguard IUD that had to be removed because of a problem, but this second one has given me no problems.I didn&#039;t have to pay for the second one because of the problem"`,

I&#039;m now tapering off clonazepam, as I hope to be able to handle the tinnitus with meditation, Effexor (anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug) and a stubborn will. I do not regret using clonazepam for 12 years, but be aware going off it can be difficult. Most doctors aren&#039;t aware it helps tinnitus!"`,

I came off them altogether and migraines just came back as before and I put on 16lb weight in a month!  All the other side effects disappeared.

Side effects for me have been extremely dry mouth, blurry vision, skin darkening on my face (cheeks) and memory/focus problems, some hair loss.

I want off of this as soon as possible due to the side effects but it has been very effective for the pain relief.

I hope the side effects goes away quickly and I regrow my hair.

It was extreme pressure in a place deep inside my body &ndash; nothing I&#039;ve felt before, but also not exactly pain. It lasted maybe 20 seconds before subsiding into the feeling of menstrual cramps. Those cramps lasted 3-4 days after insertion, and I spotted for the first month. Since then, Skyla has been pretty good. The only time I notice Skyla is during my period. My bleeding is light, but WOW do I get horrible cramps. I rarely got cramps prior to using Skyla, and these feel similar to the ones I had post-insertion. However my friends have not had this issue &ndash; every body is different. Overall I do recommend Skyla!"`,
